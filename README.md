## Email Spam Detection
This Project is build a spam detection system using Natural Language Processing and machine learning algorithms, the
dataset would be preprocessed by converting the text into numerical features
In a supervised learning algorithm various Machines would be trained on the transformed data to classify
messages as either spam or ham based on the learned patterns and features
